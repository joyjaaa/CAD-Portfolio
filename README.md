# CAD-Portfolio
Hi, welcome to my CAD portfolio that documents my progression and CAD-ing journey! :)

The CAD softwares I mainly use are SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Civil 3D, and Infraworks. The design projects I have so far created range from prototypes of parts, structures, and civil infrastructure that I have designed using CAD softwares. I am always willing to find ways to improve my designs and process, feedback and suggestions are very welcome!

Ever since I was a kid, I've always had an interest for creating and innovating by partaking in arts and crafts. I started CAD-ing during first-year of university by learning through videos, joining a design team, through my CIVE 100 course, asking questions and for suggestions from others. I want to use what I learn from CAD-ing to finding ways promote sustainability, reduce the impacts of climate change, and improve structural integrity of animal habitats to promote habitat conservation.
